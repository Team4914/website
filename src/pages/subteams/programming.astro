          PROGRAMMING SUBTEAM
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-6 font-light text-gray-500 md:text-lg dark:text-gray-400">
          Our programming subteam uses Java and Python to code the robot, which
          includes creating an intuitive and assistive control system for the
          drive team, as well as efficiently and safely utilizing the
          electronics. Being a programmer requires you to understand how the
          entire robot functions as a system, so getting involved with the other
          technical sub-teams (build, design, electronics) is encouraged.
          Although prior programming experience is useful, the willingness to
          learn is more important.

          <p>
            For added manoeuvrability, we chose to use a mecanum drive, keeping
            in mind the driversâ€™ ease of motion since the bot is fairly simple,
            such as by avoiding control arrangements that might make the driver
            accidentally make a mistake. We also slowed down some of the bot
            movements during the TeleOp period to make it easier for the driver
            to be precise.

          <p>
            In general, the Tensorflow machine learning tool manipulates frames
            by creating randomized filters to detect patterns. By the process of
            trial and error, the model trains by recognizing the team prop and
            verifies its accuracy by using a set number of manually labeled
            frames. After the model had been trained, we verified our metrics
            and trained it more for better results.

          <p>
            April tags are essentially like QR codes but for our robot. It
            provides our robot with essential data such as X and Y coordinates
            along with information such as the something. We used snippets of
            code, the April tag library provided by FTC along with our knowledge
            of Java, to piece together a program that would read these April
            tags and provide us with valuable information. We had a few hiccups
            along the way, such as the April tags being incorrectly detected, or
            identified. But through a bit of perseverance, we were able to fix
            all the issues we faced.
