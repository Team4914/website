          <p class="py-6">
            Our programming subteam uses Java and Python to code the robot,
            which includes creating an intuitive and assistive control system
            for the drive team, as well as efficiently and safely utilizing the
            electronics. Being a programmer requires you to understand how the
            entire robot functions as a system, so getting involved with the
            other technical sub-teams (build, design, electronics) is
            encouraged. Although prior programming experience is useful, the
            willingness to learn is more important.

          For added manoeuvrability, we chose to use a mecanum drive, keeping in
          mind the driversâ€™ ease of motion since the bot is fairly simple, such
          as by avoiding control arrangements that might make the driver
          accidentally make a mistake. We also slowed down some of the bot
          movements during the TeleOp period to make it easier for the driver to
          be precise.

        <p class="py-6">
          In general, the Tensorflow machine learning tool manipulates frames by
          creating randomized filters to detect patterns. By the process of
          trial and error, the model trains by recognizing the team prop and
          verifies its accuracy by using a set number of manually labeled
          frames. After the model had been trained, we verified our metrics and
          trained it more for better results.

        <p class="py-6">
          April tags are essentially like QR codes but for our robot. It
          provides our robot with essential data such as X and Y coordinates
          along with information such as the something. We used snippets of
          code, the April tag library provided by FTC along with our knowledge
          of Java, to piece together a program that would read these April tags
          and provide us with valuable information. We had a few hiccups along
          the way, such as the April tags being incorrectly detected, or
          identified. But through a bit of perseverance, we were able to fix all
          the issues we faced.
