            <p class="py-6">CAD or Computer Aided-Design is a software that allows us to design the entire robot with everything including the smallest items (bolts, nuts, washers, etc). We use CAD as a tool to communicate design ideas and details, once everything is fully planned and designed, the CAD is used as a blueprint.</p>

                <p>All solutions have a technical aspect, usually mechanical, that should be constructed and tested in order to figure out specifics (optimal dimensions/potential issues). Computer aided-design (CAD) is an integral part of the design process as it provides a means for communicating ideas visually and figuring out dimensions in a 3D space.</p>

                <p class="py-6">Similar to programming, learning to use Inventor (CAD software) requires plenty of self learning in order to use. We host workshops to get you started however, we suggest that you try to design somethings individually so you can further understand the features.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">There are many other CAD softwares including Onshape, Solidworks, Fusion360, Blendr and Autodesk AutoCAD, we use Autodesk Inventor because it can be downloaded for free with your student email and is created for designing mechanical systems. Inventory uses a parts and assembly file system, where all components (screws, nuts, motors) are designed in separate files and assembled virtually in an assembly file.</p>
