There will be workshops to help new members learn. We suggest checking these links below in your own time for a better understanding of the way FRC electronics works.</p>

It is not an end-all-be-all but hopefully will introduce you to the tools we’ll be using throughout and teach you to use them yourself.</p>

                <p class = "mt-2">Something to note is that we program in C++, so references to classes like “Encoder” and our sample codes are written in C++. However, classes are interchangeable in Java and C++, and there are topics covered in this guide that are not language-exclusive like the roboRIO and the Driver Station itself. We hope this is guide serves to be useful for you!</p>

Some images shown in this section reflect the setup for a Robot Control System using Spark motor controllers. Wiring diagram and layout should be similar for other motor controllers. Where appropriate, a second set of images shows the wiring steps for using PWM controllers with integrated wires.</p>
